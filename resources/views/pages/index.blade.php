        <p class="lead my-3"  style="text-align: justify">An internship is a period of work experience offered by an organization 
         for a limited period of time.Once confined to medical graduates, internship is used for a wide range of placements in businesses,
         non-profit organizations and government agencies. They are typically undertaken by students and graduates looking to gain relevant skills
         and experience in a particular field. Employers benefit from these placements because they often recruit employees from their best interns,
         who have known capabilities, thus saving time and money in the long run. Internships are usually arranged by third-party organizations that 
         recruit interns on behalf of industry groups. Rules vary from country to country about when interns should be regarded as employees. 
         The system can be open to exploitation by unscrupulous employers.

                <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify ; padding-top:150px ; padding-right: 120px">Companies offer students internships for a variety of reasons:<br> <br><b>Short-Term</b><br><br>
Internships provide employers with cheap (and sometimes even free) labour, for what is usually low-level office-based tasks, such as photocopying, filing, simple spreadsheet work or drafting reports. Many businesses will bring on board interns for a number of weeks or months to assist with the completion of a major project or event.This can be great for students, because it can really help you to develop and evidence skills in project management, problem solving and client relationship management. Even if the internship is only brief, it can still equip you with a range of transferable skills and help you network and build valuable connections in the industry. Plus it looks good on your CV.
<br> <br> <b>Long-Term</b> <br><br>
Employers often use internships as an effective way of advertising their graduate schemes to students. Surveys indicate that almost half of all graduate employers hire at least 20% of their ex-interns for training schemes. It is likely that graduates will return to the organisation that hired them as an intern for full-time employment after leaving university.Hiring ex-interns after they graduate ias advantageous for employers as these graduates already understand the company and the job they will be doing. Ex-interns require less training than new candidates, which saves time and resources.

                <p class="text-white" style="text-align: justify ; padding-top:150px ; padding-right: 120px">The majority of interns will carry out a range of support tasks in a junior role. The specific duties of an internship will vary considerably depending on your employer, the industry and the type of internship. Unlike conventional employment, internships have an emphasis on training, rather than employment itself.

Don’t expect to be given a client account to manage, or a creative project to coordinate, in the first week of your internship. By their very nature, internships are more of a support role than anything else.
But they are a great opportunity for you to learn how the business operates, even if you are only carrying out basic (and perhaps mundane) activities. Typical duties may include processing mail, data entry, filing, sorting through documents or scheduling appointments. That’s not a given though: some interns are given greater responsibilities and can end up becoming a key member of the team, making significant contributions to the company.

So, what should you mention if you don’t have regular work experience? Here are some ideas: <br> <br> 

<b>Volunteering</b> is an excellent way to build your experience. Don’t think about the work being unpaid; think of it as a means to an end and an effective way to develop your skills and build your network.

<br> <br>There are lots of part-time jobs that you can do in between your studies. Don’t worry too much about the type of job that you get at this stage; it is the experience and transferable skills that the internship recruiter will be looking for.

<br> <br>By joining student groups such as business clubs, associations or community groups, you can develop skills that employers look for.

<br> <br>If you don’t want to get a part-time job, freelancing is always an option, particularly in creative industries where you can build your portfolio and develop a variety of skills from marketing through to finance.          <br> <br>
